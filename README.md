# Intro to Empirical Bayes

I wanted to upgrade my ggplot-fu and I love baseball stats!

This repo contains example figures from each chapter in David Robinson's Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics

Each chapter should be completely self-contained. You should be able to run each on it's own given the proper libraries are installed on your machine.

## Installation

You will at least need the following libraries installed on your machine
 1. dplyr
 2. tidyr
 3. ggplot2
 4. Lahman

## Use

Clone this repo onto your machine, and run each chapter's `R` script on your machine
